# Minor Project: Palindrome Linked List Checker

This project is a web-based application to check if a given input is a palindrome using:

- Stack logic (for list inputs like 1,2,3,2,1)
- Recursion-style logic (for words like madam or numbers like 121)

It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## Features

- Simple and clean interface
- Works for:
  - Words (e.g., madam, racecar)
  - Numbers (e.g., 121, 12321)
  - Comma-separated lists (e.g., 1,2,3,2,1)
- Shows result with method used (Stack or Recursion)

---

## How to Use

1. Enter your input in the box
2. Click the "Check" button
3. It will show if the input is a palindrome or not

---

## Files Used

- index.html – Webpage structure
- style.css – Styling and layout
- script.js – JavaScript logic for palindrome checking

---

## Example Inputs

- madam → Palindrome (Recursion)
- 1,2,3,2,1 → Palindrome (Stack)
- hello → Not a Palindrome
